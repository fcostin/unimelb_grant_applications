ran PCA on the following, roughly, along with the response variable
replaced person 1 2 3 with team statistics, where i had em ready
(eg num prior grant applications (success and fail))


with only first 3 principal components we can get a reasonably okay division of the two clusters (there is a bit of overlap and some outliers though)

variables which kinda appear to be fairly important

- number of prior unsuccessful grants for person 1
- number of prior successful grants for person 2
- as above, for persons 2 and 3
