sort out how to properly encode the data as numerical or factor types
is there some notion of a discrete ordinal type? (randomForest probably doesnt support it)
have a crack at applying randomForest to impute the missing values
(most of the values are missing)
perhaps could work with condensed approach where we truncate or otherwise summarise the people applying (as i doubt any application actually has all 15)
