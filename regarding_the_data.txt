C   id
D   factor (0 or 1)
E   factor
F   factor
G   date

then a sequence of 5 (factor, percentage) pairs (some kind of classification and weighting)
another sequence of 15 (factor, percentage) pairs (more weighted classification)

then there are 15 people, where each person is a structure of the form

person struct:
    id              :   integer, factor
    role            :   string, factor
    birth year      :   integer, numerical
    birth country   :   string, factor
    home language   :   string, factor
    dept no         :   integer, factor
    faculty no      :   integer, factor
    with phd        :   string ('Yes' or 'No'), factor
    years at uni    :   string, factor (can order these, could also just map to ints )
    num succ grant  :   integer
    num fail grant  :   integer
    num a+ papers   :   integer
    num a papers    :   integer
    num b papers    :   integer
    num c papers    :   integer
    

nb the vast majority of records dont have anywhere near 15 people ...
